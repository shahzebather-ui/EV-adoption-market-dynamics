## Overview
This project analyzes large-scale electric vehicle (EV) registration data to understand how technology trends, pricing, policy incentives, and regional factors influence EV adoption across the United States.

## Data Sources
- State-level and county-level EV registration datasets
- Vehicle attributes including make, model year, electric range, and base MSRP
- Policy indicators such as Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility

## Approach
- Processed and aggregated large EV registration datasets using Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Built repeatable data workflows to clean, filter, and merge longitudinal data across geography and time
- Performed time-series analysis and feature engineering to evaluate adoption trends
- Created static and interactive visualizations using Matplotlib and Plotly

## Key Insights
- Battery electric vehicle range has steadily increased over time, narrowing the gap with traditional vehicles
- Policy incentives are associated with higher EV registration volumes
- Adoption rates vary significantly by region, manufacturer, and vehicle type

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly

## Additional Materials
- Project presentation summarizing key findings and insights
- Detailed written report (PDF)

## Notes
This project was completed as part of graduate-level coursework and focuses on analytical and data processing workflows rather than production deployment.
